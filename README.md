# JavaFinal
We wrote javafx application with database(postgresql). Our project's name is Hotel management system. There is a scene builder is used. Cause it is easy to create 
FXML files using Scene builder. In database there are already ready datas. datas of 2 person. In order to login user should confirm his password and write his username.
If he write his name correct and confirm his password incorrectly , then text will be appeared like  "Incorrect password"; If user write both his name and password or
only name incorrectly then text will be appeared like "There is no user with this name". But if everything is right, then it will get in. And of course user also can log out.
