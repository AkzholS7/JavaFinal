# JavaFinal
We wrote javafx application with database(postgresql). Our project's name is Hotel management system. There is a scene builder is used. Cause it is easy to create 
FXML files using Scene builder. In database there are already ready datas. datas of 2 person. In order to login user should confirm his password and write his username.
If he write his name correct and confirm his password incorrectly , then text will be appeared like  "Incorrect password"; If user write both his name and password or
only name incorrectly then text will be appeared like "There is no user with this name". But if everything is right, then it will get in. And of course user also can log out.


TEAM MEMBERS: Aibek Karshiboev, Akzhol Suborov

FEEDBACKS:

Venera:
I think it's good app, and I believe Akzhol and Aibek will continue to develop this project. Now, user can register to the system. For beginning it's very good program.

Samara:
A useful web app to facilitate the work of the receptionist. And to ensure the safety of visitors at the hotel.

Nuradil:
This program is only for hotels. Are you registered with the hotel or not? 
 He checks it out. Very well done. I wish you success in all your endeavors.
 
 Atai:
 This program might be used in hotels like in Issyk-Kul if it will be developed a little bit. From my point of fview it is really amazing idea using this application.
 
 Kalmat:
Application is absolutely comfortable for use and you can understand by using your intuition.
